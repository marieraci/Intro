# Marie Racioppa's Repositories 

Hello, my name is Marie Racioppa and I am graduate student interested in wildlife conservation. 

🦆 🦅 🦉 🦇 🐺 🐗 🐝 🦋 🐳 🦈 🦧 🦦 🦥 🦔 

I view and upload repositories in conservation planning, habitat selection modeling, and spatial analysis particularly focused on avians in North American habitats.

Please reach out if you have any interest in collaboration or questions.
