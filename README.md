# Marie Racioppa's Repositories 

Hello! My name is Marie Racioppa, I am a PhD student in wildlife conservation. 

🦆 🦅 🦉 🦇 🐺 🐗 🐝 🦋 🐳 🦈 🦧 🦦 🦥 🦔 

I'm interested in repositories regarding conservation planning, habitat selection modeling, and spatial analysis particularly focused on avians in North American habitats.

Please reach out if you have any interest in collaboration or questions.
