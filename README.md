# Marie Racioppa's Repositories 

Hello! My name is Marie Racioppa, I am a PhD student at the University of Saskatchewan working on an amazing project to study mallard survival, movement, and habitat selection. 

My masters work focused on conservation planning for the greater sage-grouse (publications coming).

I'm interested in repositories regarding conservation planning, habitat selection modeling, and spatial analysis particularly focused on avians in North American habitats.

Please reach out if you have any interest in collaboration or questions.
